# Trigonometric Functions

## The $\bm{\sin}$ function

The $\sin$ function is defined as *the ratio between the opposite of an angle $\theta$, and the hypotenuse*. Using *Fig. 1*, we can represent it as follows:

$$
\sin{\theta}=\frac{c}{b}
$$

The opposite of $\sin$, $\sin^{-1}$ or $\arcsin$, can be written as follows:

$$
\sin^{-1}{\theta}=\frac{b}{c}=\frac{1}{\sin{\theta}}
$$

## The $\bm{\cos}$ function

The cosine ($\cos$) function is very similar to $\sin$, with the only difference being that the opposite side is replaced by the adjacent one:

$$
\cos{\theta}=\frac{a}{b}
$$

Consequently, $\arccos$ or $\cos^{-1}$ is the opposite of $\cos$:

$$
\cos^{-1}{\theta}=\frac{b}{a}
$$

## The $\bm{\tan{}}$ function

The tangent ($\tan$) function is a sort of combination of $\sin$ and $\cos$, as it is the ratio between the opposite and adjacent side:

$$
\tan{\theta}=\frac{c}{a}
$$

Hence, $\arctan$ or $\cos^{-1}$ is opposite:

$$
\tan^{-1}{\theta}=\frac{a}{c}
$$

# The Unit Circle

The *Unit Circle* is a circle with a *Unit* radius, i.e. a radius of 1.

In the Unit Circle, a certain point $P$, given by the corner of a right-angle triangle with angle $\theta$, is defined as follows:

$$
P = (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))
$$

For circle in which $r \neq 1$, it can be modified as follows:

$$
P=(r \ \cos(\theta), r \ \sin(\theta))
$$
